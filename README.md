### Where I came from:

I never imagined falling in love with programming. I chose a degree in exact sciences because I found it easy, and during the course, I had some subjects focused on application development in Visual Basic and with MATLAB. Man... that was so hard.
  
One day, a friend asked me for help with an HTML course. That was the first time I started to understand how things work, and from then on, it was an endless journeyâ€”languages, concepts, patterns, studies, documentation, frameworks, and even things I donâ€™t know yet but will eventually learn. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
  
One of my biggest goals in programming is to witness transformation. I truly believe that todayâ€™s biggest changes come from technology, and I genuinely want to have a natural conversation with a robot someday. ðŸ¤–ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
